## CAP Application with Audit and Authentication Features  
**Repository:** [cap-auth](https://github.com/vasusena1234/cap-auth)

This project demonstrates authentication and authorization in an SAP CAP application using SAP BTP security mechanisms with RBAC controls for different entities.

## Audit Log Feature in SAP CAPM using System-Versioned Tables in HANA DB  
**Repository:** [cap-audit-log](https://github.com/vasusena1234/cap-audit-log)

Implements an audit log using system-versioned tables in HANA DB to track changes in the `Books` entity with a `Books_History` table for historical records.

## CAPM Audit Logging with @changelog Annotation  
**Repository:** [CAPM_Auditlogging](https://github.com/vasusena1234/CAPM_Auditlogging)

Uses the `@changelog` annotation to enable automatic change tracking for `ID` and `TEMP` fields in a CAPM-based application.

An SAP BTP Cloud Foundry application featuring Standalone and Managed App Routers with draft functionality for versioning and concurrent editing prevention.

## CAP Foreign Key Constraints  
**Repository:** [cap-foreignkey](https://github.com/vasusena1234/cap-foreignkey)

Implements foreign key constraints in a bookshop model using `assert_integrity: db` to enforce database-level referential integrity.

## CAP Side-by-Side Extension  
**Repository:** [cap-extension](https://github.com/vasusena1234/cap-extension)

Extends SAP S/4HANA functionality by consuming external OData V2 services from the SAP Sales Order API.
